## About the client
The Chatham Probus club is a retirement club of 80 - 90 people, operating from the Salvation Army center in Bowen St, Camberwell.

Probus is a group aiming to, benefit retirees in the community and provide a social and community experience for people over the age of 60.

## Website Motivation (Nature and scope of the challenge)
The club has asked for a website to attract new members to the club, they noticed that clubs surrounding them had websites that were attracting new members (an example being the [Mont Albert Probus Club](http://home.vicnet.net.au/~montalbertprobus/)).
